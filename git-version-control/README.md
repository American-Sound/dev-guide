## Overview

Git is the industry standard in version control, that is, book keeping for software engineers. Git allows us to:

- Keep a detailed but compressed history of changes to and releases of our codebases.

- Collaborate in one or multiple areas of our code with multiple developers whom we may or may not even know personally.

- Navigate to different points in the history of our softwares' lifecycle.

One important thing to note is that **Git is *not* GitHub**. GitHub is one of many Git clients, simply a user-friendly web interface for interacting with your project with some extra useful extensions provided by the client maintainers (in the case of GitHub, that would be Microsoft). Some other noteable clients are:

* [Atlassian BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
* [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/repos/)

This documentation is a work in progress. The objectives of this documentation are to:

- [ ] Get your feet wet with installing and using Git through a step-by-step example process.
- [ ] Provide a styleguide for contributing to ASEI open source projects.
- [ ] Provide links to additional resources for learning Git.
