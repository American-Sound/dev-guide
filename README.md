### QuickStart for Development

Some knowledge of Git based workflows is required, to submit changes and improvements please follow standard fork/branch workflow and submit a Pull Request when finished.

Clone a plugin repository to somewhere (we use Documents/GitHub/repo-name)

```ps2
git clone github.com/American-Sound/module-<reponame>
```

**Note:** Please only submit tested and working files, always ensure they have been labeled with the correct extensions (see below) to ensure only code changes are submitted and not syntax and spacing.
